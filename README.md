# 📊 Regression Model using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Regression Model** using Python and Scikit-learn.  
It includes data preprocessing, model training, prediction, and evaluation.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Load and preprocess a dataset
- Train a regression model
- Evaluate model performance
- Make predictions on test data

This notebook walks through the complete machine learning workflow step-by-step.
